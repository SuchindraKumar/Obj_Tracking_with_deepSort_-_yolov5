# Object-Tracking-PyTorch-YOLOv5-DeepSort

This Repository contains the implementation of Object Tracking using YOLOv5 and DeepSort in PyTorch. The combination of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art Object Detection Model, and DeepSort, a robust deep learning-based tracking algorithm, enables accurate and efficient tracking of objects in video streams.

### Requirements

* Python 3.6 or later
* PyTorch 1.7 or later
* torchvision
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* DeepSort

### Configuration

You can adjust the configuration parameters in the config.yaml file to customize the tracking behavior, such as confidence thresholds, tracking IOU threshold, and more.
