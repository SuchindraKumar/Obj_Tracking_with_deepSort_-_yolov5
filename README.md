# Object-Tracking-PyTorch-YOLOv5-DeepSort

This repository contains the implementation of object tracking using YOLOv5 and DeepSort in PyTorch. The combination of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, and DeepSort, a robust deep learning-based tracking algorithm, enables accurate and efficient tracking of objects in video streams.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
PyTorch 1.7 or later
torchvision
NumPy
OpenCV
DeepSort
